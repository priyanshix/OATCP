### Algorithm:
1. Initialize variables `f0` (initial value of function), `sum` (sum of all elements in `nums`), and `maxi` (maximum value found so far).
2. Calculate `f0` and `sum`:
   - `f0` is initialized to 0 and incremented by `i * nums[i]` for each element `nums[i]` at index `i`.
   - `sum` is initialized to 0 and incremented by each element `nums[i]`.
3. Initialize an array `dp` of size `n`.
4. Set `dp[0] = f0` and update `maxi = dp[0]`.
5. Iterate from `i = 1` to `n - 1`:
   - Update `dp[i]` using the formula: `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + sum - n * nums[n - i]`.
   - Update `maxi` to `max(maxi, dp[i])`.
6. Return `maxi`.

### Optimal Substructure
- The optimal substructure property holds because the problem can be solved by breaking it down into smaller subproblems and combining their solutions. At each step, we calculate the maximum rotation function value for a subset of the array. The optimal solution for the entire array can be found by considering the optimal solution for smaller subarrays.

### Overlapping Subproblem
- Overlapping subproblems occur because the same subarray rotation computations are performed multiple times. For example, when calculating `dp[i]`, we rely on the value of `dp[i-1]`, which has already been computed. This recurrence relationship leads to redundant calculations, making the problem exhibit overlapping subproblems.

### Time Complexity: O(N), Space Complexity: O(N)
