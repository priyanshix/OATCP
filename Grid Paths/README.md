## Input Reading:

The program reads a string from the standard input representing a path consisting of characters 'U' (up), 'R' (right), 'D' (down), 'L' (left), and '?' (undetermined).
## Path Conversion:

Each character in the input string representing a direction is converted into an integer representation: 0 for 'U', 1 for 'R', 2 for 'D', 3 for 'L', and 4 for '?'.
## Grid Initialization:

The grid is represented by a boolean 2D array with a border of true values on all sides. This creates a 9x9 grid with a border, even if the initial grid is smaller.
## Pathfinding Function (tryPath):

⚫This function recursively explores possible paths starting from a given position (curR, curC) on the grid.
⚫It checks for specific optimization conditions regarding path formation.
⚫If the endpoint (7, 1) is reached before visiting all elements of the path, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns 0.
⚫It recursively tries all possible next steps based on the current direction or if the direction is undetermined.
#### Main Function:

⚫Reads the input string, converts it into an integer array representing directions, and initializes the grid.
⚫Calls the tryPath function to find the number of valid paths.
⚫Outputs the result.
## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity: The time complexity of the algorithm depends on the number of recursive calls made during path exploration. It explores all possible paths, so the time complexity can be exponential in the worst case.

### Space Complexity: The space complexity primarily depends on the size of the grid and the recursion depth. The grid occupies O(n^2) space, where n is the size of the grid. The recursion depth can be at most the length of the path, which is O(PATH_LEN).

## Notes
This algorithm is suitable for relatively small grid sizes and path lengths due to its exponential time complexity.
For larger grids or paths, more efficient algorithms, such as dynamic programming or backtracking with memoization, may be necessary to improve performance.
